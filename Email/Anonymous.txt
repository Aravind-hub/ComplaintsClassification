Dear Lloyds,
Re: Credit Card No. 4567 1234 0123 9876

I am writing to complain about the charges you have applied to my credit card this month. My balance was £43.00 and you have charged me £12.50 for paying one day late. How can you justify this?
I have tried calling to talk to you about this, but I can't work out how to ask your IVR to let me speak to the right person. Maybe you could take a look at that too.

Yours sincerely,
Taylor Swift
