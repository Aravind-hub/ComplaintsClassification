SUB :- Request to grant a public loan for One Crore Pounds

Respected Madam,
I am an account holder at your branch since 1947 and you can See Im very decent Customer without having any negative credit. I have applied for a loan of one crore Pounds and its been 11 months from the day I proposed my loan request and
ever since no response. I am really frustated and depressed since I didn't get any response.
