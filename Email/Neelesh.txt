Subject: Frand on my lloyds credit card.
This is to notify you that i have noticed some difference in my credt card statement, where i have not made any transactions from my side.
I did registered a complaint previously but it was not addressed. Could you please help in identifying if there is any kind of fraud happened against my card.

Waiting for your early response.
Thanks
